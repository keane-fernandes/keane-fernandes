### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Keane Fernandes and I hold a double masters in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. I have a strong passion to write software to solve problems in applied engineering. I speak English and German fluently. I have extensive experience in the automotive industry and wish to work in field of autonomous driving and information security in the future.

Iâ€™m currently working on machine learning models to detect anomalies in automotive sensor data to help predict cyberattacks in autonomous vehicles. You can find out more [here](https://github.com/keane-fernandes/cybersecurity-ML-thesis).

Iâ€™m currently learning Python, CAN networking and machine learning. Alongside this, I am preparing for the [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) cybersecurity certification and aspire to be at the forefront of security technology in the future.

I believe education should be free and accessible to everyone that wants to learn. At some point down the line, Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an educational programming series on YouTube.

Here's how you can get in touch with me:
